  task: Evolving Ideas with AI
  notes: ''
qna:
- question: 1. "What specific brainstorming methodologies would you like the application
    to implement?"
  answer: 'So far: classic, lotus blossom, scamper and six hats.'
- question: 2. "Can you elaborate on what you mean by making ideas 'TDD & scope ready'?"
  answer: The tool is for devs and creators so it should allow you to evolve ideas
    from the most simple sentence to a TDD (technical design document), GDD (Game
    design document), Scope ready (Like define next steps and even tasks if possible).
    The system should support versions so you can go back to parts of the idea and
    improve them and also should allow users to branch their ideas to prove new stuff
    or pivot and then merge with what they want.
- question: 3. "What are the key features you would like this application to have?"
  answer: "It's CLI first with future UI integration and for the mvp it should have\
    \ add, improve, evolve commands, plus list, show and maybe merge versions. Ideas\
    \ are store in yml files in idee_<id> folder, they are named with the current\
    \ version e.g. v1.yml, and there\xB4s a metadata file per ide with version and\
    \ main idea info."
- question: 4. "How do you envision the user interface and interaction with the app?"
  answer: For the MVP, just a CLI
- question: 5. "Do you have any specific requirements for how the idea evolution process
    should work?"
  answer: Idea is added (Like an snapshot of the idea) where we use a LLM to ask the
    user questions related to the idea, we store the idea in its first version and
    then the user can use the id to improve and evolve. On improve the user should
    be able to add brainstorming sessions to the idea context, go back to questions
    from the qnas and develop on them, and debate with the AI, on evolve they should
    be able to branch the idea to test new concepts and merge them in the future wioth
    the main branch.
- question: 6. "How should the application handle the storage and retrieval of ideas?"
  answer: For the MVP in configurable yml file
- question: 7. "Do you have any preferences for the technologies to be used in building
    this application?"
  answer: python
- question: 8. "Are there any performance criteria the application should meet?"
  answer: Not sure now
- question: 9. "What level of AI integration are you expecting in the brainstorming
    process?"
  answer: Enough to make the idea evolution seamless
- question: 10. "How do you expect the app to assist in capturing ideas?"
  answer: Not suere yet.

summary: The proposed application is a Python-based, Git-like tool designed to evolve
  ideas from initial brainstorming to TDD & Scope ready. The application will implement
  various brainstorming methodologies such as classic, lotus blossom, scamper and
  six hats. It is designed to assist developers and creators in evolving ideas from
  a simple sentence to a technical or game design document or scope ready. Key features
  include a CLI-first design, commands for adding, improving, and evolving ideas,
  and version control for ideas. Ideas are stored in yml files, with the ability to
  branch ideas for testing new concepts and merging them back into the main branch.
  The application will also incorporate AI for seamless idea evolution, though the
  specifics of this integration are not yet defined.
