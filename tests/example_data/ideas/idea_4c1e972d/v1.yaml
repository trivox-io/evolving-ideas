summary: 'The PM system should have functionalities for creating user accounts, workspaces,
  projects, and adding team members. It should facilitate task creation, status, and
  time tracking. It needs to support collaboration features like task assignment,
  commenting, and file sharing. There''s a need for integration with applications
  like Slack, Discord, GitHub, and Notion.


  A built-in calendar for planning and scheduling would be beneficial. The system
  should be web responsive and support multi-project management. Security features
  should incorporate Django login and Django security. The notification system should
  support push notifications and optional integration with Slack/Discord.


  The system might need to support resource management and should have varying user
  access levels and permissions, including the creation of team-specific access. For
  example, front-end developers should have access only to front-end development tasks.
  There should be a feature for customer/client interaction. Specific methodologies,
  report generation capabilities, risk and issue management, budget, and timeline
  are yet to be determined.'
